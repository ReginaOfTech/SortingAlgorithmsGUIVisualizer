# SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) that demonstrates the sorting algorithms: Merge, Heap, Bubble, and Quick. 

To use: When you have ran the code a window will pop up. In the menu at the top, select the algorithm that you would like to see. If you do not select an algorithm you cannot move forward. A pop up window will remind you to select a sorting method. Once you have selected an algorithm, hit the 'Start Sort' button. Sit back and relax and learn how the sorting is done!

To start a new sort, hit the 'Create Array' button and reselect another algorithm and then hit 'Start'

Future Updates:
- Implement Merge, Heap, and Quick sort
- Perform the sorting an another thread so the user can interact with the window as the sorting is performed
- Change the color of the active column for easier user visual
- When window size is changed, graphic image moves with it
- UI update

This will be updated as each update is finished and when there is a code break down on reginaoftech.com
